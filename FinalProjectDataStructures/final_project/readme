STEPS TO RUN:

Method 1: Using the makefile
    a. run 'make'
        this should make an executable named 'TradeDLL' - this step could take a few seconds
    b. run ./TradeDLL
        you should now be able to see the program after running the executable

Method 2: Using traditional Method
    a. run 'g++ *.cpp -Wall -std=c++17'
        this should generate an executable named 'a' if you do not specify a name.
    b. run ./a.exe or ./a.out
        have fun.
